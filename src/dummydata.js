        title: "How Is The Original Contra Still So Got Damn Good",
        body: "Contra Anniversary Collection surprise launched earlier this week, and with it came the first official rerelease of the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Contra in a long while. And I have to ask: How is it that this game is still so freaking good?\n\nI try my best to not wear my rose-colored glasses when I look back at older video games. Really, I do! I understand that most things I enjoyed then are more ephemeral than not. I remember this when I hear people 10 years older than me talk about how Atari 2600 games are true “timeless classics” that “will never go out of style” and meanwhile, I look at the Atari controller and it resembles a medieval torture device.\n\n\nI fully admit that most NES games have not aged well. But goddamn, Contra has aged like a motherfucking Cabernet Franc. It’s just everything: the way the colorful graphics pop and contrast. The grotesque alien designs. The tiny yet well-defined characters, presenting a platforming-shooting-bullet-dodging challenge that’s tough, but always fair.\n\nIllustration for article titled How Is The Original iContra/i Still So Got Damn Good\nScreenshot: Konami (VGMuseum)\nThe controls. The responsiveness of a jump; push the A button and your character effortlessly backflips in the air, and you can tweak his positioning just so on the way down. In the first couple seconds of playing Contra, you can feel that pure joy at leaping while firing bullets. And that ass-kicking soundtrack blasts in, a catchy earworm of a melody that runs through a bunch of different riffs before it loops back again.\n\nWhy did the upgraded weapons fly onto the screen in capsules undulating in sine waves? Why, when you shot them down, did they land as big red winged icons with a single letter denoting what kind of gun they would grant you? Who knows! I mean, I’m sure somebody knows. But to the player, all that really matters is that in a genre where most games would have represented a new gun with a boring picture of a gun, Contra did it in a signature stylized fashion, almost like a loot box. When you hit the jackpot and a wing with an S floats down, meaning you’re about to get the “spread gun,” it’s like Christmas.\n\nYou put it all together and it’s just this beautiful harmony of sights, sounds, and action that never lets up. I’ve barely even played any of the other games in the collection yet, and I’m thinking of maybe going back and playing Contra again. You can even play the Japanese Famicom version of it in this collection, which has extra cinematic scenes and more graphical flourishes.\n\nI remember buying Contra the first time. I bought it from a kid I knew from church, at the church. It was 10 dollars. He’d kept it in the box. I don’t remember the kid. I remember the box. That box illustration was beautiful, and the game itself delivered on the promise of that box art in a way few NES games did—at least, it delivered once you got to some of the bigger alien bosses. There’s a collector out there who’ll pay $100,000 for the original of that box art. I’m OK with my $10 copy. And I’m extremely OK with Contra Anniversary Collection.",

        title: 'A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go',
        body: "When Microsoft’s video game streaming service, Project xCloud, began its beta last month, there were only four games available to test. Now there are over 50. I spent a day taking the service on the road with me to see how it’s working.\n\nCurrently, the service streams games from Microsoft’s servers to a smartphone or tablet and requires a bluetooth controller, Xbox One or otherwise, to start playing. In the future, Microsoft plans for xCloud to also stream to PCs, support touch controls, and carry save data over seamlessly from your main Xbox console. While the current version is pretty barebones, the straightforwardness is nice. Just start up the app, select a game, and start playing.\n\n\nAs someone who often commutes, sometimes long distances (Kotaku is based in New York City; I live in Philadelphia), I’m uniquely situated to benefit from the convenience and portability of video game streaming. If xCloud can let me take an Xbox One (and eventually a Project Scarlet) with me wherever I go, it could fundamentally change how video games fit into my life. Of course, so would self-driving cars. It’s not clear yet just how close either of those futures is.\n\n5:45 a.m. - The Morning Routine\nI come to. It slowly dawns on me that it is not the weekend and in fact only Tuesday. I prepare the coffee machine, put some 10-grain cereal in the microwave for my partner, and set it for three and a half minutes. This is precisely enough time to boot up the xCloud app on my phone, load Borderlands 2, and get through the opening credits. The only thing that feels different is instead of staring at a 40-some-odd-inch display in my living room, I’m staring at my Pixel 3 on the kitchen counter and simultaneously noticing where last night’s chili has left a stain on the formica.\n\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nThe Microwave pings; I deliver breakfast and take my coffee upstairs to get a shower. Borderlands 2 comes into the bathroom with me, not because I’m intent on playing but because I take my phone everywhere. Usually I sit it in the shower caddy and play a podcast. Today I spend my precious few minutes under the scalding hot water listening to Claptrap make jokes which were never funny but which, over the course of several playthroughs, I’ve grown fond of anyway. After dressing, I take a few moments to run around in the game. It’s responsive, although the audio momentarily cuts out here or there. The only place I can detect a hair of lag is in the menu system where the analog sticks on my Xbox One controller begin to feel ever so slightly sluggish.\n\n8:00 a.m. - The Train\nAfter driving to drop my 5-month-old off at my parents’, ladling leftover chilli into a tupperware container, and generally doing a bunch of other necessary things which are not playing Borderlands 2, I leave the house to grab the bus at the top of my street.\n\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Crackdown 3)\nThis should be the first big test of xCloud’s capacity to seamlessly fill the lulls in my existence over my phone’s unlimited high-speed Verizon connection. It is instead a test of whether I can juggle my coffee, backpack, phone, and Xbox controller without only one or two dirty looks from the people around me. This means means wedging my backpack between my legs, resting my phone on top, and clutching the controller in a right-handed death grip. There are no games that can successfully be played this way, but I manage to load Crackdown 3’s campaign. It also begins with a long cutscene. Terry Crews’ monologue goes off without a hitch. Then the bus hits a pothole and displaced coffee lightly sprays my setup.\n\nA few minutes later, it’s time to transition to the subway. Once I’m resituated, I drain my coffee and put the thermos away so I can focus on Crackdown. Philly’s blue line is above ground for the first half dozen stops or so. During this time, the game occasionally stutters, but nothing too bad. Instead of a constant feeling of latency, slowdowns seems to come and go all at once. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than feeling like everything I tell Crews to do is on a split-second delay. While there’s still a greater delay than if I were playing on my Xbox One at home, it’s mostly imperceptible while I squint at my phone’s small screen, surrounded by strangers whom the operator implores, for the love of god, not to go between cars while we’re in motion.\n\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Halo 5)\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Halo 5)\nThen we go underground at 46th street. The game immediately cuts out, and xCloud sends me back to the main menu. While I can generally stream music, refresh twitter, and send emails underground, stream Crackdown my phone cannot. Anyway, I need to be ready to make a mad dash at my stop to make my train to New York.\n\nOn the train, I pull down the tray from the seat in front of me and fashion a makeshift phone stand out of my journal and some napkins. This time I boot up Halo 5, opting for a quickplay multiplayer match. I assume it’s going to be a dumpster fire, but surprisingly, it works! I’m loaded into a game of Slayer with seven other people and somehow manage to get my first kill within seconds. Everything works, from shooting to throwing grenades to sprinting. Occasionally the screen melts into a pool of random colors and shapes, after which I’m usually killed or find myself running into a wall, but I don’t get disconnected. What would be dreadful for a high-stakes competitive match feels surprisingly satisfying for being on a train going over 100 miles an hour. I wish I could grind through any number of battle passes on my console games this way.\n\n3:30 p.m. - The Office\nAt work, I switch to the office wifi, which performs noticeably worse than my phone. I try a smattering of games between other tasks. Mark of the Ninja, a single-player indie stealth game from several years ago, plays flawlessly for the opening level. Ace Combat 7 struggles. While it feels inherently impressive to be flying through its beautiful skies on such a small device, the occasional lapses in control send me spiralling into the water.\n\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (West of Dead)\n8:00 p.m. - The Megabus\nAfter leaving work but before running to catch my Megabus, I check a GameStop to see if they have any phone mounts for my controller. The guy tells me that they are only really sold online currently but suggests I try a Best Buy several blocks away which, because it’s in the opposite direction of my ride home, I have to abandon.\n\nFortunately, but weirdly, the bus was mostly empty. Do my former Mega-ites know something I don’t? If I must go out in a blaze of double-decker glory, I decide it would only be fitting if I were playing Forza Horizon 4 when shit went sideways. The game was gorgeous when it came out last year and looks remarkably crisp and vibrant on my phone. Steering has the same problems I encountered with Ace Combat, leaving me to veer off course as I try to overcorrect during the lag. I’ve never set record times in Forza, and I’m certainly not going to do it when the picture quality constantly crashes, but for the periods when everything is running smoothly—chunks of 10 seconds—it’s fun to be gunning it down an English countryside in a McLaren Senna while a 100-ton steel death trap shuttles you through Northern Jersey’s industrial parks.\n\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Forza Horizon 4)\nIllustration for article titled A Day Of Trying To Stream Xbox One Games While On The Go\nScreenshot: Kotaku (Forza Horizon 4)\nBack in Philly, I switch to Soulcalibur VI for the last leg of my trip. Fighting games are fast and unpredictable, and I expect the game to be a jittery mess. In an arcade mode match, I only suffer one framerate crash. The music occasionally cuts out, but the fighter’s movements (Mitsurugi, always Mitsurugi) look and feel fluid enough. I could conceivably play through the game’s entire incomprehensible story mode this way. Instead I switch to an online match where I promptly get my ass kicked, but not because of any technical glitches. I’ve played online matches in games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate at home with more lag and latency than what I experienced streaming a few matches of Soulcalibur VI.\n\n11:15 p.m. - Back Home\nI play one more match at home on my own Wifi. Parts of it are better than the previous one I’d just played on the bus. Parts of it are worse. Throughout the day, I’d done speed tests to measure my connection. Whether on Wifi or LTE, my speeds varied wildly, sometimes from 5Mbps (very slow) to 25Mbps (fast), sometimes within the span of a few seconds (the service requires a minimum of 10Mbps down). In the end xCloud used 2.54 GB of data for somewhere just over an hour of usage.\n\nThe hardest thing about getting a firm grasp of any streaming technology is isolating all of the other variables involved. In xCloud’s case, that’s my phone, my cell provider’s coverage and signal strength, and the Bluetooth connection to my controller. Ironing out all of those kinks seems like a monumental task for a single company, even one as big as Microsoft or Google.\n\nFor those low-key moments, the experience doesn’t necessarily need to be perfect. While I’m impressed by how well xCloud performs in testing, the most appealing thing about it, at least right now, is the already large library of games it works for. Performance matters a lot when you’re sitting down to play a big game you’re really psyched about, but when you’re casually trying something out, xCloud’s current library of 50-plus games is an enticing way to catch up during downtime.",

        title: 'Some People Who Pre-Ordered Stadia Say They Still Can’t Access It',
        body: "In June, Google made an enticing offer for its new streaming service, Stadia—anyone who pre-ordered the Founder’s Edition would be able to lock in the usernames of their choice before anyone else could. Now, however, some people who pre-ordered the service say they haven’t even gotten in. Instead, they still find themselves waiting for an email from Google with their login information a day after the video game streaming service launched.\n\n“Anyone else wake up disappointed,” reads a post on the Stadia subreddit, where early adopters have spent the last 24 hours sharing their hopes, dreams, and frustrations with the service’s messy launch. While some who pre-ordered Stadia’s Founders Edition received their controller, Chromecast Ultra, and membership info yesterday, others are still waiting, either for their order to ship, for emails with instructions for setting up their account, or both.\n\n\n“We’re aware that some of you who pre-ordered Founder’s Edition may not have received your invite codes in the expected time-frame,” said a Stadia community manager on the subreddit yesterday. In a subsequent update that evening, the Google representative said the problem was fixed. “We’ve identified an issue where a small fraction of Stadia access codes were sent out of order,” they said. “That has been addressed.”\n\n\nGoogle’s Stadia Just Ain’t It [Updated]\nGoogle’s game-streaming platform Stadia is finally here tomorrow. I’ve had a week to tinker around…\n\nRead more\nFounder’s Editions were originally unveiled during a June 6 stream. In addition to a special Night Blue version of the Stadia controller and a buddy pass to get a friend signed up toStadia for free, people who pre-ordered would also get first dibs on choosing their platform name. For some, those naming rights were the sole reason they pre-ordered.\n\nPeople who are still waiting on codes have latched onto a July 18 comment made by Stadia’s director of product, Andrey Doronichev, saying reservation emails would be sent out in the order pre-orders were received. But some users on the subreddit who pre-ordered in September have already received their shipment confirmation and registration emails while others who pre-ordered in June haven’t. Even if it’s only a very small number of people who are affected, the mixup has left a bad taste in many people’s mouths.\n\n“My order has still not been shipped,” Reddit user Gamesearch56, who pre-ordered Stadia on June 8, told Kotaku in an email. If I don’t receive my code till friday, because i would use stadia on a family trip with my laptop, I will cancel my preorder. So disappointed in the whole launch.”\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n[Update - 1:31 p.m. 11/21/19]: Two days after launch, Google now says that Stadia access codes have gone out to everyone who pre-ordered Stadia in June.\n\n“We have begun moving through the sequence of orders placed on or after July 1st so that those players can join us on Stadia soon too,” the company said on Twitter.\n\nIt’s worth noting that these are only the access codes to login and start using Stadia. Actual pre-order packages, containing the controller and special Chromecast Ultras, are still in the process of being shipped.\n\nReddit user Gamesearch56 confirmed to Kotaku that they received their access code overnight, allowing them to finally try out the video game streaming service they were one of the first to pre-order.",

        title: 'Pokémon Sword and Shield sell sports star mystique better than any Madden game',
        body: "There’s no shortage of video games falling all over themselves to tell you how special you are. As a medium built, like no other, on direct audience participation, gaming has a vested interest in making you, the consumer, feel like the Special Chosen One Person Of Destiny, a hybrid of Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, and Tony Stark—a humble superhero genius who just happens to hold the fate of billions in their hands. There are exceptions, of course, with “Video games that want you to know what a huge piece of shit you are” having been a fairly recent addition to the medium’s artistic repertoire. But for the most part, it’s the rule, even when it descends into absurdity with massively multiplayer games like World Of Warcraft, which constantly reassure you that you’re very special, just like all your thousands of friends.\n\nThe Pokémon games have always had a weird relationship with this sort of baked-in power fantasy. It’s the rare franchise that (almost) always starts with the player as an actual child, a direct stand-in for either the person holding the controller, or at least their former, more innocent selves. Under their players’ ball-chucking guidance, these obsessive youths slowly embark on quests that typically culminate in becoming both the savior of the planet, and its most celebrated sporting star. And yet, despite the fact that you typically end each game as tween LeBron Jesus, most of the games in the Pokémon series fail to fully acknowledge your newfound superstar status, even though they exist in a universe where the people who do not mention the ubiquitous magical creatures every time you talk to them could exist on the fingers of one extremely out of touch hand.\n\n\nThe franchise’s latest installments, Sword and Shield, come equipped with the usual slate of refinements to the series’ well-tested formula, complete with ever-more convenient fast-travel options, numerous quality of life improvements across the board, and even a wilderness zone that slaps a dollop of trendy roguelike mechanics on top of the series’ classic fare. Combined with the usual addition of almost criminally charming new monsters (and adorable, Britished-up versions of some of the classics), it does pretty much exactly what you might want out of a new main series Pokémon game: More of the same—but now on Nintendo’s endlessly convenient Switch.\n\nIllustration for article titled iPokémon Sword /iand iShield /isell sports star mystique better than any iMadden/i game\nImage: The Pokémon Company\nBut the most interesting thing about this latest duology is how it plays into the series’ long-present sports star metaphor, amping it up to the point where it can actually hit you square in the feelings, like a soccer ball aimed directly at the gut. Sword and Shield’s version of Pokémon battle fandom is transparently lifted from British football culture, complete with rowdy hooligans, cheering crowds, and lush green playing fields that somehow remain pristine even as lightning-powered rats and flame-wielding rabbits battle it out on top of them. Your main character’s rival is even the little brother of the Galar region’s absurdly cape-wearing champion, the equivalent of growing up next door to the captain of your favorite football club, playing keepie-uppie with him whenever he’s not out on the road. (The addition of small backyard practice battle arenas in people’s homes around the country is another nice little touch.)\n\nBut the extent of the games’ approach to your future sports ascension doesn’t become fully clear until you’ve made the long and winding trip to its brick-covered London equivalent, where you’re asked to suit up in a crisp, numbered uniform and participate in a welcoming ceremony for the annual League competition. The accompanying cutscene has a mundane function in terms of the game’s pacing, introducing you to each of the Gym leaders you’ll spend the next several hours tracking down and beating up to get your all-important badges. But it also emphasizes the celebrity and splendor of the culture you’re opting into, with crowds gamely cheering you the way they might root on a group of prospective Little League champions. The feeling only deepens once the ceremony ends and you emerge back out onto the road—where crowds of well-wishers have gathered to yell encouragement as you set out on your world tour/religious pilgrimage to each of the region’s gyms. It’s emotionally affecting in a way that Pokémon games typically aren’t; not just congratulatory, but also supportive, in a way that acknowledges that while you’re not a star just yet, you could be some day.\n\nThat feeling of rising superstardom is emphasized by another of Sword and Shield’s clever elements: League Cards, which allow players to fulfill their childhood fantasy of having a rectangle of celebratory Topps cardboard of their very own, listing off accomplishments, and redolent with the scent of decades-old dried gum. Past Pokémon games tried to capture these same feelings by letting you cut glorified wrestling promos with your favorite ’mons, but the process was typically tedious, slow, and given to creating amateur horror movies more often than flashy highlight reels. The new system—which allows you to both collect the cards of in-game celebrity NPCs, as well as trade your own with people you play with online—boils the appeal of having a League Card down to its basics; it’s also one more way the game sells its rising-star narrative.\n\nTo be fair, this isn’t exactly new territory for gaming. Sports simulators like Madden and NBA 2k have been selling career modes on the backs of this “YOU are the STAR!” treatment for years. But those franchises also inevitably turn into, well, sports games: Team endeavors in which your carefully crafted avatar becomes just another set of stats and number in a play. But even as you swap in and out the monsters doing all the actual work with mercenary disdain, Pokémon never stops being your story, a ground-level account of (forcing others to help you in) overcoming adversity, carving out a reputation, a skill set, and, ultimately a place at the top of the pile. Pokémon has always been powered by the drive to make yourself a champion, to catch them all and reign supreme. Sword and Shield are the first games in the series to realize the potential of making you a star.",

        title: 'Nintendo Was Worried Donkey Kong Country Was "Too 3D"',
        video: "0Uo52EwyiCc",
        body: "This week marks the 25th anniversary of the classic and beloved Donkey Kong Country. To celebrate this milestone, some of the developers behind the game took part in a series of interviews about the game, its development and its release. And according to one developer who worked on the game, Nintendo was actually worried the game was “too 3D” and that it would be too overwhelming for players and they would be unable to actually play it.\n\nReleased on Nov. 21, 1994 for the SNES and developed by Rare, DK Country was a 2D platformer built using 3D-looking assets. In a new 1 hour interview and documentary from Shesez, best known for the popular Boundary Break videos, we learn a bunch of interesting information about the development of this classic game.\n\n\nFor example, did you know that the design of Donkey Kong was just a big gorilla with the eyes from a Battletoad slapped on it? OR that the Kremlings, enemies in the game, were actually originally part of a different failed project?\n\n\nAnd yes, Cranky Kong is the original Donkey Kong from the arcade games. Though Rare didn’t promote this too much in the game or in ads because they were worried Nintendo would change or remove the character if they did.\n\nThe whole video is just over an hour-long, so you might want to grab some snacks and a drink before you start watching. But for fans of Donkey Kong Country and or folks who love learning more about old games, this video is worth watching.",
